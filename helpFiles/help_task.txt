task- manage a fow's task 
Usage: task [options]
Reporting and editing a task and their objects.

A task is the working unit, saved in a subdirectory of 02_PROCESS. 
A task can be set active, so all task manipulating commands are done on this task. The complete task name has always the structure <folder>/<name>.    
A task has a defined subfolder structure, that should not be changed, but additional subfolders can be added. Subfolders for a photo task:
/jpg - original jpg files
/raw - original raw files
/final - task output, jpg files, that can be exported
/work  - working directory, for instance for gimp files
The name of the taskroot can be changed without side effect.

Usage reporting: task [--short|-s]
task: Reports a list with all images of the actual task. 
task --short, task -s: Reports a brief status of the actual task. 

Options:
--create <name>, -c <name>: Creates a new task in the same folder of the actual task in 02_PROCESS/<folder_actual_task>. The task name may not exists.  
--create <folder/task>, -c <folder/task>: Creates a new task in the particular subfolder of 02_PROCESS. A task has to be structured in a one-level folder path. For instance "weeklyPicture/<task>".   
-a <task>, --activate <task>:  Set this task as the active one.
-r, --raw-import: Move corresponding raw files for all images in jpg of the actual task, taken from 01_Import. Source and destination subfolder is /raw. Existing raws in the destination folder are untouched. Action is independent of the final folder. 
--missing-raws, -m:  Dry run to list the raws to be imported into the actual task.
