.SH NAME

Usage: task [options]
.SH DESCRITON
Reporting and editing a task and their objects.

A task is the working unit, saved in a subdirectory of 02_PROCESS. 
A task can be set active, so all task manipulating commands are done on this task. The complete task name has always the structure <folder>/<name>.    
A task has a defined subfolder structure, that should not be changed, but additional subfolders can be added. Subfolders for a photo task:
/jpg - original jpg files
/raw - original raw files
/final - task output, jpg files, that can be exported
/work  - working directory, for instance for gimp files
The name of the taskroot can be changed without side effect.
