.SH DESCRIPTON
Reporting and editing a task and their objects.

A task is the working unit, saved in a subdirectory of 02_PROCESS. 
A task can be set active, so all task manipulating commands are done on this task. The complete task name has always the structure <folder>/<name>.    
A task has a defined subfolder structure, that should not be changed, but additional subfolders can be added. Subfolders for a photo task:
/jpg - original jpg files
/raw - original raw files
/final - task output, jpg files, that can be exported
/work  - working directory, for instance for gimp files
The name of the taskroot can be changed without side effect.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-\-create <name>, \-c <name>
Creates a new task in the same folder of the actual task in 02_PROCESS/<folder_actual_task>. The task name may not exists.  
.TP
\-\-create <folder/task>, \-c <folder/task>
Creates a new task in the particular subfolder of 02_PROCESS. A task has to be structured in a one-level folder path. For instance "weeklyPicture/<task>".   
.TP
\-a <task>, \-\-activate <task>
Set this task as the active one.
.TP
\-n, \-\-next
Set the next task to the active one (All tasks can be listed with 'show tasks').
.TP
\-p, \-\-previous
Set the previous task to the active one (all tasks can be listed with 'show tasks').
.TP
\-r, \-\-raw\-import
Move corresponding raw files for all images in jpg of the actual task, taken from 01_Import. Source and destination subfolder is /raw. Existing raws in the destination folder are untouched. Action is independent of the final folder. 
.TP
\-f, \-fill\-final
Copy all images from jpg to final, if the image is not already there. This can be used to complete the image set in final, for not touched images. The comparison for the image name is case sensitive, but not for the suffix. For instance final/IMG1.jpg and jpg/img1.jpg are different images, but final/IMG1.jpg and jpg/IMG1.JPG are handled as one image.
.TP
\-\-test, \-t
Dry run, just print what would happens. Can be used for \-\-raw\-import and \-fill\-final.
